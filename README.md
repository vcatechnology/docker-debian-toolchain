This container derives from
[vcatechnology/debian-ci](https://hub.docker.com/r/vcatechnology/debian-ci) so that the
image has the latest [Debian](https://www.debian.org/) packages. It then
installs the some useful packages for building projects with the
[VCA Tool Chain](https://gitlab.vcatechnology.com/tool-chain/tool-chain).

Available on Docker Hub as [vcatechnology/debian-toolchain](https://hub.docker.com/r/vcatechnology/debian-toolchain/)
